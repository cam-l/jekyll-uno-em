My research interests are strongly focused on potentiating connections and relationships that not only promote well-being and connection through creative and playful modes but are transformed in ways that are meaningful and becoming. With roots in traditional knowledge practices such as psychology, I have turned towards posthumanism and new materialism for the extraordinary capabilities to map the sensory, affective, and haptic elements that entangle lived experiencing. I am particularly intrigued in how matter and materiality of everyday objects and artefacts co-produce mental health and well-being. Adopting a relational ontology enables interdisciplinary collaborations, extending beyond the boundaries of conventional practice to reveal more critical understandings of complex human experiences.

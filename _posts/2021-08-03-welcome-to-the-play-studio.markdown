The philosophy and practice of the Melbourne Play Studio believes becoming ‘*good enough*’ is transformational and holistic. By drawing from psychotherapies that enable all clients to feel secure in themselves whilst learning to tolerate imperfection and uncertainty, becoming good enough is realised through a lived process of playing, creating, and connecting.

At The Melbourne Play Studio, we believe strongly in a humanistic offering of therapy meeting people where they are at, so they can unfold in ways that enable an authentic and fluid becoming of self. The therapeutic modalities we use are evidence-based but without  a ‘*clinical*’ feeling. Our focus and interest is in strengthening a whole you, decided by you, by what is important to you.

Emma has diverse research experience and interests that cross disciplinary boundaries and enjoys/seeks interdisciplinary collaborations that innovate new ways of doing “intervention” capable of contemplating the complexity of lived experiencing. She is passionate about (re)conceptualising well-being, trauma, and mental health within a relational ontology, inquiring with post qualitative methods and new
materialism that agitate for more responsive innovations in mental health.

As an independent researcher, Emma’s focus is on inquiring into everyday lived experiencing through posthumanist experimentations are that tangible, accessible, and provocative. Emma has presented and published on multimodally mapping the more-than-human elements that compose lived realities, with a forthcoming chapter being published in 2025.

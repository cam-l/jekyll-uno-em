Renowned for her work and research in Infant Arts Therapy, Emma is an experienced Infant Mental Health Consultant, Child Psychotherapist, and Arts Therapist and believes strongly in the need to turn towards relational and creative approaches to support trauma-healing and attachment.

Coming up to 20 years, Emma’s experience has focused on trauma healing, disordered eating/eating disorders, and child and women’s mental health. She has held various senior roles in community organisations supporting children (0-18 years) with a lived experiencing of family violence, early life trauma, child protection, and adversity including an IMH consultancy role with Berry Street for 3.5 years and a research position at a family violence service.

Emma is committed to demonstrating trauma-responsive practice alongside adopting client-led, neuro-affirming, and culturally safe principles that centre clients and their lived realities to enable moving towards a meaningful and connected life.

As an accredited supervisor, Emma’s approach to reflective supervision and companioning draws from the same relational frame capable of holding practitioners in their work with infants and parents. Thinking/working/reflecting with psychotherapy theories helps to maintain and develop the thinking mind and feeling heart needed to bear the unbearable, and attune, respond, and reflect.

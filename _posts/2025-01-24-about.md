Emma’s ethos to practice, writing, research and for living is bringing forward creative, playful, and relational ways of connecting that promote relational health and emotional wellbeing. This turn towards an arts and play approach to knowing and being was the influence of the many infants and young children she has supported over the years to heal from trauma and overcome adversity. 

The remarkable capacity of infants to express emotions and share their inner worlding is largely through creativity and play modes that are the occupation of children. Artistic, playful and relational practices are transformative of mental health and wellbeing, stimulating authentic communication and expression of lived realities through curious, exploratory, and responsive modes.

First obtaining a Bachelor of Psychology and Master of Counselling, Emma’s passion for working with little humans and the therapeutic benefits of the arts and play therapy has been extended with a doctoral degree in Therapeutic Arts Practice as well as post graduate studies in Child Psychotherapy. She has undertaken comprehensive training in the field of infant mental health where she is an experienced IMH practitioner, consultant, and supervisor.
